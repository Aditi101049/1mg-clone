            <p>When will I get an answer to my query? What happens if I don’t get a response?</p>
            <p>If you opt for a free consult, then we make sure the doctor replies within 24 to 48 hours. In case of a paid consult,

                time,

            <p>Our doctors will give you expert advice on your problem and help you identify next steps which may include further
                tests, medicine recommendation or lifestyle tips. Few cases require face-to-face examination and we do ask patients
                to
                share pictures or reports if they can, for a conclusive diagnosis.</p>
